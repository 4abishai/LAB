To execute a Bash script named `script.sh` from the command line, type:

```bash
bash script.sh
```

This command tells the Bash shell to interpret and execute the commands within the `script.sh` file. Make sure the script file is in the current directory or provide the full path to the script file if it's located elsewhere.
