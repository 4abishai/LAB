To execute a Bash script named `Script_Name.sh` from the command line, type:

```bash
bash Script_Name.sh
```

This command tells the Bash shell to interpret and execute the commands within the `Script_Name.sh` file. Make sure the script file is in the current directory or provide the full path to the script file if it's located elsewhere.
